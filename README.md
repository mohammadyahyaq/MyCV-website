	2- Style the website using CSS and we used some advanced CSS properties
	3- We added behaviour to our website using Javascipt and we used the following concepts, DOM, Event Listeners, client-side input validation, and Email Scrambling
	4- We build the backend using PHP and we used the following concepts, include header and footer for the web page, retrieve and upload data from MYSQL database by our website, server-side input validation, and using some global variables like session variable to add statefulness to our website.
	5- uploading the website to a real hosting service with our own domain name
	6- adding a subdomain to our website from the hosting service
